    <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
    <li>1 pound hanger steak, sliced across the grain 1-inch thick</li>
    <li>1/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>1/3 cup dry red wine</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon unsalted butter</li>

    <li>1 tablespoon chopped flat-leaf parsley</li>

  </ul>
 <h5>Directions</h5>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large skillet, heat 2 tablespoons of the olive oil until shimmering. 
            Add the mushrooms and cook over moderately high heat until softened, about 3 minutes. 
            Season the mushrooms with salt and pepper and cook for 1 minute longer. 
            Transfer the mushrooms to a bowl.</li>
        <li>Generously season the steak with salt and pepper.
             Toss the steak with the flour until evenly coated; gently tap off the excess.</li>  
        <li>Heat the remaining 2 tablespoons of olive oil in the skillet. 
            Add the steak slices, without touching, and cook until richly browned, about 5 minutes. 
            Transfer the steak to the bowl with the mushrooms.</li>    
        <li>Add the wine to the skillet and stir to scrape up the browned bits from the bottom of the skillet. 
            Add the wine to the mushrooms and steak.</li>     
        <li>In the same skillet, melt the butter until bubbling. 
            Add the onion and cook until softened, about 3 minutes.
            Season with salt and pepper. 
            Add the garlic and cook for 1 minute.</li>   
        <li>Return the contents of the bowl to the skillet. 
            Stir in the stock and Worcestershire sauce and simmer over moderate heat until the pan juices thicken slightly, about 7 minutes.</li>     
        <li>Remove from the heat and stir in the sour cream, thyme, and parsley.
             Season the stroganoff with salt and pepper and serve over fettuccine or egg noodles.</li>
    </ol>
